# Abstract

Many daily choices are based on one’s own knowledge. However, when predicting other people’s behavior, we need to consider the differences between our knowledge and other people’s presumed knowledge. Social agents need a mechanism to use privileged information for their own behavior but exclude it from predictions of others. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural implementation of such social and personal  predictions by manipulating privileged and shared information. The medial frontal cortex appeared to have an important role in flexibly making decisions using privileged information for oneself or predicting others behavior. Specifically, we show that ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracked the state of the world independent of the type of decision (personal, social), whereas dorsomedial regions adjusted their frame of reference to the use of privileged or shared information. Sampling privileged evidence not available to the confederate also relied on specific interactions between TPJ and frontal pole.
